//Write a program that takes two numbers and displays their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

//Declare and initialize two variables with number values
const num1 = Number(11);
const num2 = Number(11);

//Declare and initialize four more variables with arithmetic operations performed on num1 and num2
//Add num1 and num2
const sum = num1 + num2;
console.log(`Sum: ${sum}`);

//Subtract num2 from num1
